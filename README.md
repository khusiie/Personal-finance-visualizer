Features
The Personal Finance Visualizer is developed in three progressive stages.

In Stage 1, users can add, edit, and delete transactions that include an amount, date, and description. These transactions are displayed in a list view, and a monthly expenses bar chart provides a visual overview. Basic form validation ensures clean and structured input.

Stage 2 introduces predefined categories for transactions such as Food, Transport, and Rent. A category-wise pie chart offers a visual breakdown of expenses, while the dashboard presents total expenses, a category-wise summary, and a list of the most recent transactions, enhancing usability and clarity.

In Stage 3, users can set monthly budgets for each category. A budget vs actual spending comparison chart is displayed to show how spending aligns with budget limits. Additionally, users receive basic insights into their spending patterns based on those limits.

 No login/authentication implemented as per guidelines
